# MP2---Two-Way-Linked-List-ADT

[PLEASE SEE mp2.pdf FILE FOR FULL INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION!](mp2.pdf)

The goal of this machine problem is to build an implementation of a list ADT which includes a set of fundamental procedures to manipulate the list. You will implement the list using two-way linked lists, and define a general-purpose interface that will allow us to use this list ADT for the remainder of the semester. You will then re-write the MP1 honeypot application to utilize the new list ADT.

A key element in this assignment is to develop a well-designed abstraction for the list so that we can return to this interface and replace it with either (a) a different application that needs access to a list or (b) change the underlying mechanism for organizing information in a sorted list (e.g., other than a two-way linked list).

You are to write a C program that will maintain the two lists of packet information, one sorted and the other unsorted.
